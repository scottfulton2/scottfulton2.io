        <h3>This Website</h3>
        <p2>
          Yes, this very website that your currently viewing is a project that I've had to do
          for web authoring, one of six 1st year modules. <br></br>
          Since I've already mentioned what was used to create this website and how it was made,
          I will instead say that I have enjoyed creating this website and I am proud of what I have
          managed to create.

        <h3>Interactive Installation</h3>
        <p3>
          This is one of the assignments I had to complete for the creative interactions module.
          As part of a group of 5 people, we had to create an interactive program that would (hypothetically)
          be installed in the Dundee Room inside the newly openend V&A mueseum in Dundee. Our Group created a
          quiz about the RRS Discovery, one of Dundee's most famous landmarks, in order to encourage people
          to not forgot an important part of Dundee's History.

        <h3>MSN Poster</h3>
        <p4>
          In order to show what I learned about the different aspects of design in the web authoring module,
          I had to show what I learned by creating a poster which had been designed using
          these aspects and the poster had to be about the design of website and how it has
          changed throughout time. I decided to do my poster aboout the MSN website. I found
          it quite interesting in terms of just how much websites have chnaged over time and
          how they have improved from the widening range of code available to the web developers.

        <h3>Control Assignment</h3>
        <p5>
          This is another assignment I'm particularly proud of. This is because I remember I struggled
          considerably with learing JAVA to begin with in the introduction to software development
          module. <br></br>Anyway, what I had to do for this assignment was create a program which
          displayed a menu of various options to the user and the program processed their choice and performed
          the task chosen by the user. The options available included a grade calculator, a statistics calculator
          and a table of values generator.

        <h3>Snapchat Assignment</h3>
        <p6>
          For this assignment, Myself and 4 other people had to create a program for the creative
          interactions module which had allowed the user to edit an image with multiple interactions, such as,
          a pen which changed colour everytime the user clicked their mouse, a hat which appeared When
          the user pressed the up key and a pair of sunglasses appeared when the user pressed the down key.

        <h3>Reversi Project</h3>
        <p7>
          This is the project that I am currently working on and I am finding it very very challenging so far.
          For this project I have to create a program which allows the user to play a game called Reversi.
